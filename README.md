# Cebrail Portfolio

# [PROJECT 1 : Spaceship Titanic :](https://github.com/cebsmind/portfolio/blob/main/TitanicSpaceShip.ipynb) 
* **What I Have Learned**:
1. *Enhanced proficiency in data preprocessing techniques.*
2. *Gained hands-on experience in using Python for data analysis and machine learning.*
3. *Developed skills in model evaluation and interpretation.*

## Key steps :

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Utilized Pandas for comprehensive data exploration.
  - Employed Matplotlib & Seaborn for creating visualizations to gain meaningful insights into the dataset.

* **Data Preprocessing**:
  - *Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis and modelisation*
  - *Addressing missing values*
  - *Encoding categorical and ordinal variables. Also scaling numerical variables*
  - *Feature engineering to create meaningful variables to gain model performance.*
  - *Creating a pipeline to preprocess our data*

* **Model Development**:
  - *Employed Scikit-learn for building predictive models.*
  - *Applied a GridSearch to find the best model & hyperparameters*
   

* **Model Evaluation and Interpretation**:
  - *Assessed model performance using relevant metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.).*
  - *Interpreted model outcomes and discussed potential implications.*
  - *Used "Learning Curves" to have a better view of our model performance and see if our model is over fitting or not*
