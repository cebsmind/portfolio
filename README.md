## What I Have Learned:
1. *Enhanced proficiency in data preprocessing techniques.*
2. *Gained hands-on experience in using Python for data analysis and machine learning.*
3. *Developed skills in model evaluation and interpretation.*

## Key steps :

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - *Utilized Pandas for comprehensive data exploration.*
  - *Employed Matplotlib & Seaborn for creating visualizations to gain meaningful insights into the dataset.*

* **Data Preprocessing**:
  - *Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis and modelisation*
  - *Addressing missing values*
  - *Encoding categorical and ordinal variables. Also scaling numerical variables*
  - *Feature engineering to create meaningful variables to gain model performance.*
  - *Creating a pipeline to preprocess our data*

* **Model Development**:
  - *Employed Scikit-learn for building predictive models.*
  - *Applied a GridSearch to find the best model & hyperparameters*
   

* **Model Evaluation and Interpretation**:
  - *Assessed model performance using relevant metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.).*
  - *Interpreted model outcomes and discussed potential implications.*
  - *Used "Learning Curves" to have a better view of our model performance and see if our model is over fitting or not*

* **Submitted my predictions to Kaggle and ranked in the top 27% on the leaderboard**


# [PROJECT 2 : Immunization (COVID-19) Project](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/cebrail/viz/ImmunizationFlu/Tableaudebord1)
- [Data source](https://github.com/cebsmind/portfolio/tree/main/sql-data)
- [SQL code](https://github.com/cebsmind/portfolio/blob/main/SQL-code)
- [Tableau visualisation](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/cebrail/viz/ImmunizationFlu/Tableaudebord1)
  
## Objectives : Create flu shots dashboard for 2022 that does the following
1. *Total % of patients getting flu shots stratified by*
   - Age
   - Race
   - County (On a Map)
   - Overall
   
2. *Running Total of Flu Shots over the course of 2022*
3. *Total number of Flu shots given in 2022*
4. *A list of Patients that show whether or not they received the flu shots*
   
## Key steps :

* **Used SQL (PostgreSQL) to clean, filter, and prepare the data for Tableau.**
  
* **Utilized Tableau's functionalities to create a variety of visualizations :**
  - *Flu Shots by Age (Barchart)*
  - *Flu Shots by Race (Barchart)*
  - *Flu Shots By County (Map)*
  - *Running sum Flu Shots 2022*
  - *Flu Shots List*
    
* **Dashboard preview :**
